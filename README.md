# Working with the [Python Canvas API](https://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/canvas-ref.html)

This repo contains random bits and pieces I've used for interacting with Canvas programmatically.

Currently contains workflows for:

- [Creating assignments and rubrics](create_assignment_and_rubric.ipynb)
- [Grading an assignment](grade_assignment.ipynb)
- [Creating groups](canvas_groups.py)
